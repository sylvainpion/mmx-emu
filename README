Welcome to the MMX emulation library project !

It provides a simple way to execute (thus slowly) binaries that use MMX
instructions, on processors that do not support them.

It can be used if you want to develop MMX code, or execute MMX binaries, on a
non-MMX Intel compatible CPU.  Note that well written MMX binaries should
contain the equivalent non-MMX code, since the emulation will always be really
slow, and MMX code is all about speed.

As a test program, I used mmxtest, from libmmx-980616, foundable on sunsite, in linux/libs.
