Welcome to the MMX emulation library project for Linux !
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the beta version 0.6.
It should emulate correctly all the Intel MMX instructions.
Cyrix'EMMX and AMD'3DNow! instruction sets are supported,
but less tested yet.


It provides a simple (but slow) way to execute binaries that use MMX
instructions, on processors that do not support them.

It can be used if you want to develop MMX code, or execute MMX binaries, on a
non-MMX Intel compatible CPU.  Note that well written MMX binaries should
contain the equivalent non-MMX code, since the emulation will always be really
slow, and MMX code is all about speed.

As a test program, we use mmxtest (from libmmx-980616).  Please test it on your
MMX programs, to check if it works exactly like on a real MMX processor.
Please report your successes and failures to the list !

Read the INSTALL file to know how to use it.

Here is a qualitative speed indication:
- time taken to enter the sighandler and exit it:
  2200 cycles on a Pentium MMX (9.5 micro second at 233MHz)
  2850 cycles on a 486 DX4    (28.5 micro second at 100MHz)
- this is done once per consecutive set of emulable instructions.
- the emulation in itself should take ~200 cyles (?) per instruction on average.
