Welcome to the MMX emulation library project for Linux !
--------------------------------------------------------

This is the first beta version 0.5.
It should emulate correctly all the Intel MMX instructions.


It provides a simple way to execute (but slowly) binaries that use MMX
instructions, on processors that do not support them.

It can be used if you want to develop MMX code, or execute MMX binaries, on a
non-MMX Intel compatible CPU.  Note that well written MMX binaries should
contain the equivalent non-MMX code, since the emulation will always be really
slow, and MMX code is all about speed.

As a test program, we use mmxtest (from libmmx-980616).  Please test it on your
MMX programs, to check if it works exactly like on a real MMX processor.
