This useless (but nice !) project of an MMX emulation library !

It provides a simple way to execute (slooowwwwly) binaries that use MMX
instructions, on processors that do not support them.

It can be used if you want to develop MMX code, or execute MMX binaries, on a
non-MMX CPU.  Note that well written MMX binaries should contain the equivalent
non-MMX code, since the emulation will always be really slow, and MMX code is
all about speed.

The code is, of course, placed under the LGPL.

Example of how to make it work:
LD_PRELOAD=/home/syl/prog/mmx-emu/libmmxemu.so   ./mmxtest

To run mmxtest (taken from libmmx), you need mmx.h, that comes with libmmx.
