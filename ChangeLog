Release 0.6 beta.  23 October 1998

- signal() replaced by sigaction(), no need to re-install the handler after
  each SIGILL => one syscall less.
- handling of the environment variables:
  MMX_EMU_NO_LOOK_AHEAD, MMX_EMU_NO_CYRIX_EMMS, MMX_EMU_NO_AMD_3DNOW.
- In case of bad instruction, that even MMX-Emu doesn't recognize, raise
  SIGILL.
- Added pointer to web page and mailing-list in the README.
- mmx_ill_handler() takes struct sigcontext as 2nd argument... much better.
- mmx_logical.c uses long longs.
- mov* are written with a macro now.
- split mmx_ill_handler.c into mmx_decode.c and mmx_ill_handler.c.
- include/context.h to support compilation under 2.0.x kernels.
- simple script "mmx-emu.sh" added.
- Cyrix stuff integrated, not tested.
- 3DNow! stuff integrated, not tested.
- bug in movd2mmx (must zero dest[1]).
- movd2mem <-> mov2mmx inversed in mmx_insn[], same for movq...
- address computation re-written from scratch (from the specs).
- Cyrix' mulhrw bug fixed.
- mmx_emu.h renamed emu.h
- mmx_saturate.h renamed saturate.h
- updated the exponent of FP registers when using moves, and TOS word.
- 3 booleans mmx_unit_present, emmx_unit_present and _3DNow_unit_present.

Release 0.5 beta.  10 July 1998

- MMX should work completely.
