The never decreasing list of things to do:
------------------------------------------

- Make it work !  As a test-suite, use mmx_test.c.  Find other programs !
- Test if the operand decoding work for pshi*.

- Put the Mod/rm decode in each small function, which becomes void padd(void),
  this avoid useless tests for emms, and mov[dq] ?

- Extend the emulation to AMD, Cyrix...  AMD's 3DNow!, MMX2... FPU ? ...
- Add options, via a environement variable (MMX_EMU_OPTS), to set behaviours,
  such as: do we support other types of instructions set, do we strictly follow
  the real behaviour, etc...

- Check why the logical functions do not work with long longs, they would be
  cleaner.

- Should we modify the TOS (cf Chapter 4 of Intel's doc) ?  There are also
  other things to check...

- About the look-ahead, it should be disabled when tracing is enabled !!!
  NB:   FPU_lookahead = 1;
        if (current->flags & PF_PTRACED)
          FPU_lookahead = 0;


For speed:
----------
- Benchmark the thing !

- Use sigaction() instead of signal()  (one syscall less I guess) ?

- Tune compile options in the Makefile.
