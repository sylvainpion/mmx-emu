- Make it work !  As a test-suite, use mmx_test.c.  Find other programs !
- We should find out that operand decoding don't work in all cases...

- Benchmark it !
- Implement look-ahead (should be easy when cleaned up), and re-do the benchs.
  NB: FPU_lookahead = 1;
      if (current->flags & PF_PTRACED)
        FPU_lookahead = 0;
- put the Mod/rm decode in each small function, which becomes void padd(void),
  this avoid useless tests for emms, and mov[dq] ?

- Extend the emulation to AMD, Cyrix...  AMD 3DNow! ? MMX2 ...

- The MMX-Emulator may allow combinaisons of operands that are not available on
  real MMX.  This should not be a problem for "normal" emulation, but could
  lead to problem.  Add a flag for exactness (e.g. via an environement
  variable) ?

- Use sigaction instead of signal.
