"make"		builds libmmxemu.so
"make test"	builds and runs the test-suite
"make clean"	cleans up the source tree.


After the built, only libmmxemu.so is needed, you can remove everything else.
To make it work on the program "program", just type:

LD_PRELOAD=/the/path/of/libmmxemu.so  program

Defining the following variable:	does the following action:

MMX_EMU_NO_LOOK_AHEAD			emulate one instruction at a time
					(useful for debugging)

MMX_EMU_NO_CYRIX_EMMX			do not emulate the Cyrix EMMX
					instructions (the default is to emulate
					them too)

MMX_EMU_NO_AMD_3DNOW			same thing for AMD's 3DNow! instruction
					set


You can also use the script "mmx-emu.sh" (edit it first), and simply type:
mmx-emu.sh program
