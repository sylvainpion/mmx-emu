      This is the official home page of the MMX Emulation Library Project
      for Linux/x86.
      Here is the <a href="./MMX_Emulator_fr.html">French translation</a>.
    </p><p>
      It works only on Linux, and on Intel compatible processors, for the
      moment.
    </p><p>
      FAQ: MMX-EMU does not work under Windows, and we don't know about any
      equivalent package for Windows, sorry.  Please do not send us mails
      about this, we won't answer them.
    </p><p>
      This library provides a simple way to execute (but slowly) binaries 
      that use MMX instructions, on processors that do not support them.
    </p><p>
      It can be used if you want to develop MMX code, or execute MMX binaries,
      on a non-MMX Intel compatible CPU.  Note that well written MMX binaries 
      should contain the equivalent non-MMX code, since the emulation will 
      always be really slow, and MMX code is all about speed.
    </p><p>
      The emulator also contains emulation code
      for Cyrix and AMD variants of MMX (EMMX and 3DNow!).
