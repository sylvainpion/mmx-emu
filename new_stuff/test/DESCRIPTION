About : mmx_types.h
By including mmx_types.h you have a C-Interface to access the mmx-world.
Without even a need to have any mmx-hardware. Programs including mmx_types.h
run on whatever non-mmx-CPU, of course on mmx-CPU's, too ;-)


About : mmx_v1.c
Just a testprogram showing how to use mmx_types.h


About : Makefile
make all or make "target" will do the job


About : mmx_3dn.c
The problem is that there is positive and negative Zero
defined at AMD-3dn definitios. This is not handled at the moment
in the pfcmpeq routine. I wanted to avoid as much overhead as
possible, some routines can be done without fpu.
The other point is that i consider Unsupported Values like NAN
beeing processed as : NAN = NAN, will say pfcmpeq(nan,nan) -> "True"
in fact the float definitions do that too. But AMD says they are
Undifined.

So for testing you can do the folowing:
Try to play around with libmmxtest.c 
(you know it uses the bl**dy c-iface)


About: cpuspeed.c
It shows the speed of your CPU by using the TSC-register


Hint:
You can pipe the results of the running programms into less examine
the results more closely.



Have Fun
